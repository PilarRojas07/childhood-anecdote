Sad and happy at the same time
I remember when i was a girl we used to go out with my parents on weekends to the park and they took me to practice skating and on one of those days i tripped over a stone, this made me fall, causing a severe injury to my ankle
it wasa sadday but atthe same time happy well that memory of seeing my parents united, my heart full of joy.
